# R-PiAlerts
Build a WiFi Based Security System With Raspberry Pis
While working at your desk, suddenly you hear a distant noise. Did someone just come home? My car is parked in front of my house, did someone break into my car? Don't you wish you got notification on your phone or at your desk so you can decide whether or not to investigate? Well question no more! R-PiAlerts is here!

What is R-PiAlerts?
R-PiAlerts is a Raspberry Pi3 based security system built around Firebase's Cloud. If movement is detected, the system will notify the user of a potential break-in with a text message (via Twilio) and a blinking LED display (silent visual alarm of sorts). Once user receives a notification, he or she can investigate. All detected movement will be logged to the Firebase database. Besides viewing the movement log on a web browser, the user can also access the movement log via an iOS app.
